ET: Legacy Asset Documentation
============================================
Welcome to ET: Legacy's Asset Documentation!

The original assets included in pak0, pak1 and pak2 unfortunately weren't included in the `source release <https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory>`_. For `ET: Legacy <http://www.etlegacy.com>`_ to ever become independent of these paks, there is the need of creating replacements. To keep a proper overview of the process, this documentation includes a full list of all original assets and the state of their replacements in ET: Legacy.
